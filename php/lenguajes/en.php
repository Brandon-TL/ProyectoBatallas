								<div class="questions">
									<div class="faq faq-one">
										<h2 class="faq-title">What are the battles?</h2>
										<div class="faq-answer">
										Battles are user-created matchups between any two elements, which let the community know which of those elements
										items are the favorites or the most valued thanks to the voting system.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="hr"></div>
									<div class="faq faq-two">
										<h2 class="faq-title">What are the elements?</h2>
										<div class="faq-answer">
										Elements are objects of the same environment <em>(languages, series, brands...)</em> against each other through battles.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="hr"></div>
									<div class="faq faq-three">
										<h2 class="faq-title">What happens if I report a battle?</h2>
										<div class="faq-answer">
												By reporting a battle, you will be implying some of the following points:<br><br>
											<ul>
												<li>That the elements have no relation to each other <em>(Example: Fire vs. Audi)</em>.</li>
												<li>That the elements contain content that may be offensive to other users <em>(Example: homophobia, racism, hatred towards some
												set of people, etc.)</em>.</li>
											</ul><br>
											Once you have reported a battle the user will automatically receive a point of <em>troll</em> in your personal account.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="hr"></div>
									<div class="faq faq-four">
										<h2 class="faq-title">What are troll points?</h2>
										<div class="faq-answer">
											The points of<em>troll</em> are negative points that users get for each complaint of the battles they have created, these points are
											cumulative and also count as a vote, so you can only vote for one item or report the battle for it. When 80% of the votes
											totals of a battle are complaints, this will be removed for all users and its creator will get a point of <em>troll</em>.<br><br>
											The users with 10 points<em>troll</em> accumulated will be banned from the system and you will not be able to register again with the same credentials.
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="hr"></div>
									<div class="faq faq-five">
										<h2 class="faq-title">Can I recover my account if it has been banned?</h2>
										<div class="faq-answer">
										All bans are subject to review, so if your account has been unfairly banned you must wait for the administrators to
										check your case.<br>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="hr"></div>
									<div class="faq faq-six">
										<h2 class="faq-title">What are achievements?</h2>
										<div class="faq-answer">
										Achievements are a system of rewards for interaction with battles, both your own and those of other users.<br><br>
										Achievements for creating battles:<br><br>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Engaged</strong>: You have created 10 battles for the community.</li>
												<li><strong>Vicious</strong>: You have created 100 battles for the community.</li>
												<li><strong>Addicted</strong>: You have created 1000 battles for the community.</li>
											</ul><br>
											Achievements for voting battles:<br><br>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Voter</strong>: You have voted in 10 battles of other users.</li>
												<li><strong>Syndicalist</strong>: You have voted in 100 battles of other users.</li>
												<li><strong>Activist</strong>: You have voted in 1000 battles of other users.</li>
											</ul><br>
											Achievements for reporting battles:<br><br>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Vigilant</strong>: You have reported 10 battles.</li>
												<li><strong>Moderador</strong>: You have reported 100 battles.</li>
												<li><strong>Polic√≠a</strong>: You have reported 1000 battles.</li>
											</ul><br>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="hr"></div>
									<div class="faq faq-three">
										<h2 class="faq-title">You have reported several battles, but your achievements are not progressing.</h2>
										<div class="faq-answer">
											In order for complaints to count towards achievements, the battles in question must be removed (80% of the total votes are complaints).<br>
											This prevents users from reporting random battles to get the achievements faster.
